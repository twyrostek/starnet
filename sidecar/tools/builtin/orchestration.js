/* sidecar/tools/builtin/orchestration.js — team.dispatch: the LEAD delegates subtasks to its summoned
   WORKER crew. The Stage-2 moat: a lead decomposes a task and hands subtasks to specialist workers, each of
   which runs its OWN real, independent agent loop (web/files/memory), and returns its result for the lead to
   synthesize. CONTRACT-FREE: no shared/events.js change — children emit the SAME frozen agent.run.* events,
   forwarded (lifecycle + cost only) onto the lead's bus so the floor can ANIMATE the handoff.

   makeOrchestrationTools({ runOnce, roster, key, model, provider, reasoningEffort, perWorker, newId, maxWorkers })
     runOnce   : the SAME run host the browser/cron use (injected to avoid a require cycle) — async (o) -> result
     roster    : () -> Map(agentId -> { system, name, model }) — the live crew identities (pushed by the browser)
     key       : this run's API key (per-run)        model : the lead's model (worker fallback)
     perWorker : per-WORKER USD ceiling (a runaway worker can't blow the lead's per-run cap)
     workerMaxIters: optional per-WORKER iteration ceiling (0/omitted = unlimited)
     newId     : () -> a fresh runId for each child (crypto.randomUUID, injected so this UMD stays dep-free)
     maxWorkers: optional cap on workers per dispatch (0/omitted = unlimited)

   Safety (verified against the run host): each worker is a DISTINCT agentId so it takes its own concurrency
   slot + its own ledger/live-budget entry while the lead's slot stays held; ctx.signal is threaded into every
   child so cancelling the lead aborts all workers; the child runOnce returning undefined (concurrency refusal /
   up-front error) is null-guarded; only the worker's FINAL assistant message is returned (never the full
   transcript) to stay under the per-run tool-output cap. */

Each worker runs its OWN real agent loop (live web search/read, files, memory) and returns its result for you to synthesize into the final answer. Address workers by the agentId listed under YOUR TEAM. Runs sequentially by default; pass parallel:true to run them at once. Pass background:true to start watchable workers and keep working. SESSIONS: pass `session` on a worker (the session\'s NAME, as the Commander says it) to make that subtask run in — and be filed under — that session instead of this one. Use an existing relevant session or create a named working session first. A name that does not match one on this station is REFUSED, not guessed, and that worker does not run. FILES: each worker saves into its OWN private workspace — you cannot fs.read another agent\'s files, so never "verify" a worker\'s file with your own file tools (absence in YOUR workspace proves nothing). The result\'s artifacts list is the proof of what each worker saved, and the Commander is shown those files as cards automatically — reference them as "<workerId>\'s workspace: <path>".',
